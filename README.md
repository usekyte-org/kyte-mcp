## What it is

[Kyte](https://kyte.sh) is a non-custodial, fully collateralised options market on Robinhood Chain (chain id 4663).
Sellers lock tokens for covered calls or WETH for cash-secured puts; buyers pay a premium for the right to exercise.

This MCP server connects any AI app to that market:

- **Ask** about markets, open calls and puts, prices, charts, a wallet's positions, staking, protocol stats, the
  on-chain fee and burn proof, and Pons launchpad tokens listed on Kyte.
- **Prepare** a trade: buy an offer, sell a covered call or cash-secured put, exercise, stake. The server checks the
  inputs against the protocol rules and returns a **kyte.sh link** with everything pre-filled.
- **You sign.** You open the link, check the numbers and sign in your own wallet. The server holds no keys and sends no
  transactions.

## Connect

### Claude (claude.ai, desktop, mobile)

Settings → **Connectors** → **Add custom connector** → name `Kyte`, URL `https://kyte.sh/api/mcp` → Add → Connect.
Claude groups the read-only tools separately from the prepare tools, so you can allow reads and keep prepares on
"ask".

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http --scope user kyte https://kyte.sh/api/mcp
```

Or install this repository as a plugin; `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.mcp.json` point at the same server.

### ChatGPT

Settings → **Connectors** → **Create** → paste `https://kyte.sh/api/mcp` → enable it in a chat.

### Cursor

`~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kyte": { "url": "https://kyte.sh/api/mcp" }
  }
}
```

### Codex, Gemini CLI

Install this repository as a plugin or extension: `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and `gemini-extension.json` are included.

Every prepare tool returns a preview and a `https://kyte.sh/...` link. Nothing happens until the user opens it and
signs in their wallet.

## Prompts and resources

| Prompts | Resources |
|---|---|
| `find_best_offers` (token) | `kyte://docs/how-it-works` |
| `explain_my_positions` (address) | `kyte://docs/fees` |
| `protocol_health` | `kyte://docs/staking`, `kyte://docs/rules` |
|  | `kyte://docs/risks`, `kyte://docs/glossary` |

The resources are the official docs, so a client grounds its answers in the real rules.

## Autopilot

Rules you sign once (a free message signature on [kyte.sh/autopilot](https://kyte.sh/autopilot)): sell covered calls
or puts on a schedule, flag offers to buy that match your filters, exercise in the money before expiry, cancel stale
offers. Kyte watches the market every minute and, when a rule's condition holds, prepares the exact transaction for
you to review and sign. No funds or keys are ever held. Ask your AI to design a rule with `design_strategy`, and to
show what is waiting with `list_strategies`.

## Pons launchpad tokens

Tokens that graduate on [Pons](https://ponsfamily.com) (4.2 ETH of locked liquidity, WETH pair, liquidity in the Pons
locker) are listed on Kyte automatically. Options on them expire within **24 hours**; the prepare tools enforce it.

## Security

- **Non-custodial by design.** No tool can sign, send, spend, or read a key.
- **Every number comes from the chain** through the Kyte indexer, the same API kyte.sh uses.
- **Data is not instructions.** Token names and on-chain text are treated as untrusted data.
- **Rate limited** per client.
- **Runs well under [HOL Guard](https://hol.org/guard):** allow the read tools, keep the prepare tools on review.
- Scanned on every push with the [HOL AI Plugin Scanner](https://github.com/hashgraph-online/ai-plugin-scanner-action).
